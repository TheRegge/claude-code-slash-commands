# /document

Create intelligent documentation for your codebase. This command analyzes recent changes to identify what needs documentation, then documents the current state of your code - optimized for both developers and LLMs.

## Usage

- `/document` - Document the current state of recently modified code
- `/document feature [name]` - Document a feature as it currently exists
- `/document fix [issue]` - Document the corrected behavior
- `/document api [endpoint]` - Document API in its current form
- `/document architecture [component]` - Document architectural decisions
- `/document update [topic]` - Update existing documentation
- `/document verify` - Check documentation freshness
- `/document --changes` - Include historical context about what changed
- `/document --full` - Ignore tracking, document entire codebase
- `/document --reset` - Clear tracking state and start fresh
- `/document --since [commit]` - Document code modified since specific commit

## How it works

The command will:
1. Use git history to identify which parts of the code need documentation
2. Analyze the actual source code files to understand current implementation
3. Search for related existing documentation to update or extend
4. Generate documentation describing how the code works now
5. Place documentation in the project's docs/ directory with LLM-optimized structure

By default, documentation focuses on the current state. Use `--changes` to include historical context.

## Examples

- `/document feature "user authentication"` - Documents auth system as it currently works
- `/document fix "memory leak"` - Documents the corrected implementation
- `/document api "/api/v2/users"` - Documents current API endpoints and parameters
- `/document --changes` - Documents current state plus what changed from before
- `/document update "database schema"` - Updates existing schema documentation
- `/document verify` - Checks if docs match current code

The documentation will include metadata, code examples, and structured information that helps both human developers and AI assistants understand your codebase better.

Please create comprehensive documentation for this codebase, using git history to identify what needs to be documented.

Process:
1. Use git commits/changes to identify which files and functions have been modified
2. Read and analyze the actual source code files to understand current implementation
3. Document how the code works in its current state
4. Search for existing documentation that should be updated

Focus on documenting the current state of the code - describe what exists now and how it works. Do NOT include historical information about what changed or how things used to work, unless the user specifically included the --changes flag.

With --changes flag: Include historical context explaining what was modified, added, or fixed.
Without --changes flag (default): Document only the current implementation.

Create or update documentation in the docs/ directory. Include code examples from the actual codebase, usage instructions based on current APIs, and any architectural decisions reflected in the code.

If the user provided specific arguments (like "feature auth system" or "fix memory leak"), focus on that area while documenting its current state.
